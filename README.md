# Gesture Recognition Using AWS

Introduction: This project basically tries to predict a gesture by
 taking JSON data as an input on an AWS server and gives String name of the gesture
 as an output to server.
 
- I have uploaded both python scripts and server scsripts along with the Training dataset for the
  total of 6 Gestures.
- ml_models.py python script trains a ML model and saves it as .sav file
- Server.py calls these .sav files to predict a particular gesuter by taking json data as an input.
